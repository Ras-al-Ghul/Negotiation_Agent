# Negotiation Agent
A Multi-Party Negotiation Agent for the GENIUS platform.  
Came first in a 10 team tournament with an average utility of 0.408.  

## Run
- Compile the source.
- Place this in the GENIUS platform's directory.
- In the GENIUS Platform (ANAC), go to `Parties`, right-click and `Add new Party`
- Locate the `Group5.class` file (obtained after compiling in step 1), and select it.
- Now you can run `Group5` agent in your Multi-Party Simulators.

## Heuristic and Results
The ideas implemented in the agent, and a few performance metrics are highlighted in the `Group5.pdf` report in `deliverables/3.zip`.
